<h2>Abstract</h2>

The recent trend in health care has been on the development and
implementation of clinical guidelines to support and comply with
evidence-based care.&nbsp;Evidence-based care is established with a
view to improve the overall quality of care for patients, reduce costs,
and address medico-legal issues. One of the main questions addressed by
this thesis is how to support guideline-based care. It is recognised
that this is better achieved by taking into consideration the provider
workflow. However, workflow support remains a challenging (and hence
rarely seen) accomplishment in practice, particularly in the context of
chronic disease management (CDM).
<p>Our view is that guidelines can be knowledge-engineered into four
main artefacts: electronic health record (EHR) content,
computer-interpretable guideline (CiG), workflow and hypermedia. The
next question is then how to coordinate and make use of these artefacts
in a health information system (HIS). We leverage the EHR since we view
this as the core component to any HIS.</p>

<p>We use the openEHR architecture, which allows extension of a core
Reference Model via Archetypes, to refine the detailed information
recording options for specific points in the healthcare process, to
represent decision support information needs, and to represent the
composite instruction that is the workflow itself. We present an<br />

Instruction Reference Model from which composite instructions can be
defined and is an extension to the current openEHR&rsquo;s Instruction
model (revision 4.3). We define constructs for the rationale of the
decisions made to be recorded explicitly within the record &ndash;
including the specific guideline step, didacticism, and links to
relevant EHR data items that were used to arrive at a decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We develop a prototype system that makes use of two key components:
the Breeze workflow architecture, and our implementation of the EHR
Persistence Layer &ndash; both of which interact in the initiation and
execution of instructions. We illustrate our approach on two distinct
but common CDM scenarios: Early Supported Discharge and associated
Post-stroke Rehabilitation, which is process-oriented and less clinical
in nature; and Hypertension in Diabetes which is of a highly clinical
nature, and decision-based.</p>

<p>We found that there is a real distinction between the roles that
guideline-based recommendations provided by CiGs, workflow and EHR play
in supporting and managing patient care: (1) CiGs model decision-making
steps and recommended actions; (2) workflows model the work to be done
for that recommended action, by whom, when and how, and help ensure
that it gets done; (3) archetypes help ensure that the appropriate
information is collected within the EHR for the workflow. Moreover, the
extent to which each of these components can be used in supporting CDM,
particularly CiGs and workflow, is dependent on the clinical context in
which it is applied.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our research has implications on various stakeholders. The extended
EHR architecture allows the application designer to choose a usable
balance of compliance<br />

encouragement and human judgment. The ability to track healthcare
process steps within the EHR content is also of medico-legal
significance. It is envisioned that<br />

extensible EHR recording allows the EHR to serve as the basis for care
coordination, and potentially improve communication amongst providers
and even improve patient health outcomes. Our open framework can be
used to further explore the problem of effective support for CDM (such
as presentation of hypermedia), and can inform a range of standards
bodies (such as HL7), researchers (such as clinical guideline
representation and workflow) and vendors about specific requirements
for integrating EHR, workflow and guideline-based decision support.</p>
