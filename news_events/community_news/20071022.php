			<h2>Archetype Editorial Group launched</h2>
			<h6>22. October 2007 | from: Thomas Beale</h6>
			<br/>
			
			<p>The lead group for archetype authoring has been formed - the Archetype Editorial Group. This group will work with Sebastian Garde to finalise the process for the authoring of archetypes and begin the ratification of all archetypes. The archetypes will then be stored in a web-based environment that will provide a lot of background information and also manage the orderly release of updates. It is an international group, predominantly doctors at the outset. It is hoped that the next group will provide the leadership for Nursing archetypes.</p>
