December 2008 | from: Thomas Beale</h6>			<br/>						<p>The openEHR Foundation is pleased to announce Release 1.0.2 of the specifications. In what appears to be a strong sign of stability, only 15 Change Requests were needed, of which only 7 had any effect on the formal specifications, and no impact on existing schemas or data. <a href="/programs/specification/releasehistory/release102">Specification home page</a>; <a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC/fixforversion/10030">release notes</a>.
