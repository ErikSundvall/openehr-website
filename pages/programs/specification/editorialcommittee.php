				<p>Having trained in Medicine and completing PhD in Information Systems, Koray's main focus is on Electronic Health Records (EHR). He has led development of a number of successful applications. The most prominent one is the <a href="http://pathos-web.sourceforge.net">PATHOS-WEB Project</a> for reporting and analysis in anatomical pathology. Installed in some 25 large laboratories in Turkey, more than two million records have been collected since 1996. In order for health informatics to be recognised as an academic discipline he played a key role during establishment of the Department of Medical Education and Informatics at Hacettepe University. Koray then led work for the development of health informatics curriculum and a graduate program in health informatics.</p>

				<p>Thomas's academic background is in Electrical Engineering (communications) and Computer Science. His earlier professional work was in real-time distributed control (SCADA) systems, investment management and finance, and document and software configuration management systems.</p>
				<p>After participating in the GEHR project in 1994 in the UK, he has worked since 1998 on EHR architectures, and participated in international standards work (OMG HDTF, HL7, CEN TC/251). He is one of the founders of the openEHR Foundation, and designed the archetype formalism (ADL) and object model (AOM), now an ISO standard. He has published a number of <a href="http://wolandscat.net/publications/">papers in health informatics</a>. He has also presented widely on EHRs, e-Health and archetypes.</p>
