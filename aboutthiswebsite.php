			<h1>About this Website</h1>
			<p>This new website aims to be more representative of the openEHR community aims and activities and particularly what people are working on out there. Don't consider it as fixed, but rather as a living thing. We are interested in feedback on any aspect of the website. In the initial development phase, visual elements and style are 'draft', and we welcome ideas for improvement.</p>
			<p>Note that the technical approach we have taken with this site is a totally manual one - that is, it is constructed from hand-built HTML, PHP, and Java-script. This gives more freedom than the controlled environment of a CMS. Moving to a CMS is not out of the question in the future, but for now, the current approach seems more maintainable. The website code is maintained on Github, and contributors can participate by providing material via that route.</p>

			
			<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
			<p>Please provide website design ideas/feedback <a href="http://www.openehr.org/wiki/display/oecom/2012+Website+-+feedback+page">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Routine webmaster requests <a href="mailto:webmaster@openehr.org">here</a>.
			
			
			<h2>Logo</h2>
			<p>As openEHR is moving forward we think it is time to refresh Foundation image. Besides the new website, there is also a possibility for openEHR community to create a new openEHR logo. A few proposals have been made already.</p>		
			<p>You can vote for openEHR logo <a href="#">here</a>. Table below shows all possible candidates. You can also send your own creation <a href="mailto:webmaster@openehr.org">here</a> and we can put it as a candidate for voting.&#42; The deadline for logo candidates is 31. December 2012. The deadline for voting for logo is 31. January 2013.</p>

The doctors graphic may also seem more in the style of commercial e-health vendor advertising rather than a .org. Alternatives: any visual content that gives the idea of computing in healthcare.</td>

			<h2>The motto</h2>
			<p>A number of ideas have been tried here. This is meant to be a short sharp expression of what the openEHR Foundation and its community are about. Key ideas to include seems to be: archetypes/content models; flexibility/future-proofing/adaptibility of systems. Clearly no slogan can capture everything about a large effort like openEHR, so there will never be a perfect one. On the other hand being memorable is useful. Suggestions are welcome <a href="mailto:webmaster@openehr.org">here</a>.</p>
